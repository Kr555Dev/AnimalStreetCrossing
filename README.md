This is a 3D unity game which was inspired the classical game frogger.
# Coding Rule
Please do not work on main -> main should hold a stable version

Create your own new Branch which can later be merged.

Dev Branch holds first merge versions. They may need debugging !!!!!
If they are debugged they can be merged into main.
