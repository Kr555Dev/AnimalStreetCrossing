This is a 3D unity game which was inspired the classical game frogger. The player (wolf) can be moved with w,a,s,d or the arrow keys. It is possible to jump with space. The goal is to reach the end of one level. Here the player can earn more points if he or she collects the coins. Initially, the wolf has 3 lifes. If the player collides with cars or the water than one life will be reduced.


# Coding Rule
Please do not work on main -> main should hold a stable version

Create your own new Branch which can later be merged.

Dev Branch holds first merge versions. They may need debugging !!!!!
If they are debugged they can be merged into main.
